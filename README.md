Conway's Game of Life meet poseNet web cam

In my latest project, I've developed an interactive website that brings to life the 'Game of Life', a cellular automaton devised by John Conway. This grid-based game evolves each cell based on its neighbors, representing the unpredictability of life's interactions. My twist on this concept involves integrating PoseNet, a machine learning model that allows users to interact with the grid using their body movements. As you move in front of your webcam, you directly influence the cells on the screen, creating a dynamic interaction between physical motion and digital change.

This project is more than just an engaging visual experience. It's a reflection on digital communication, exploring how even in a world of instant connectivity, our messages can be altered and lost. It's a metaphor for the 'noise' in our digital conversations and how our intentions can evolve unpredictably, much like the cells in the Game of Life. I invite users to engage with this platform, not only to enjoy the visual interplay but also to ponder the complexities of communication in our digital era.
